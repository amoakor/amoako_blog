    "text": "Abstract:\nMental health programs aim to prevent or mitigate mental illness and promote psychological well-being. Evaluating the effectiveness of these programs is crucial, yet it presents unique challenges. This paper proposes a comprehensive culturally responsive evaluation (CCRE) framework specifically tailored to assessing school-based mental health programs in rural Appalachian communities. The Appalachian region of the United States faces significant challenges in addressing elevated rates of youth mental health issues, driven by socioeconomic disadvantages, limited access to care, and distinct cultural factors. While school mental health initiatives have emerged as a promising approach, rigorous evaluations are needed to examine their implementation, outcomes, and long-term community impacts through an Appalachian cultural lens. The proposed CCRE framework integrates core principles of cultural responsiveness with a nuanced understanding of Appalachian traditions, values, and knowledge systems. It provides structured yet flexible guidance across five stages: 1) Comprehensively analyzing the multi-layered community and sociopolitical contexts; 2) Collaboratively designing the evaluation with diverse local stakeholders to surface culturally-relevant priorities and indicators; 3) Implementing culturally-relevant, participatory inquiry methods and capacity building; 4) Engaging the community in collectively analyzing and contextualizing findings through an Appalachian worldview; and 5) Prioritizing local dissemination formats and translating insights into sustained community actions. By centralizing Appalachian voices, ways of knowing, and self-determination throughout the process, this framework aims to enhance evaluation validity, community buy-in, and long-term impacts on addressing mental health disparities. It presents a paradigm shift towards more ethical, equitable evaluations that authentically resonate within the distinct rural Appalachian cultural context.\nKeywords: Rural Appalachia, School Mental Health programs, Culturally Responsive Evaluation, Program Evaluation, Community engagement, Local knowledge systems"

    "text": "Abstract\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in higher education, enhancing learning experiences and optimizing administrative processes. However, integrating AI into teaching and learning practices remains underexplored, particularly concerning educators’ readiness and perceptions. This study aimed to develop and validate the Comprehensive AI Integration Readiness Survey (CAIIRS) to assess higher education educators’ readiness and willingness to integrate AI into their teaching, learning, and assessment practices. A nationwide survey was conducted among educators at public and private universities across the United States. The survey instrument, CAIIRS, was designed based on an extensive literature review and expert input. Data was collected online, and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to determine the underlying factor structure. The EFA revealed three main factors: Integration and Effectiveness of AI in Teaching, Institutional Support for AI Integration, and Anxiety about AI Technology Use. The study found general recognition of AI’s benefits but highlighted significant anxiety among faculty and varying levels of institutional support. The findings underscore the need for comprehensive professional development and strong institutional support to facilitate effective AI integration. The CAIIRS scale provides a valuable tool for assessing faculty readiness and guiding targeted interventions, highlighting the complexities of adopting AI in higher education.\nKeywords: Generative Artificial Intelligence, Educators, Higher Education, Scale Development, Exploratory Factor Analysis, AI Integration\n\n\n\n\nWith My West African Colleagues at AERA 2025, Denver"

    "text": "I am excited to share my research, insights, and experiences in the fields of evaluation, education, health, and data science. My goal is to create a platform for discussion and collaboration among researchers, educators, and practitioners who are passionate about improving educational and health outcomes through data-driven approaches. I am Richard Dickson Amoako, a PhD student in the Department of Educational Leadership and Policy Studies at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I hold a Master of Public Health (MPH) and a Master of Science (MS) in Development Evaluation and Management. My research interests include educational evaluation, data visualization in evaluation, CRE frameworks and the application of artificial intelligence in education. I am passionate about using data to inform policy decisions and improve educational and health outcomes for all students. I have a strong background in quantitative research methods and statistical analysis, and I am skilled in using various data analysis tools and programming languages, including R, Python, and SQL. My work has focused on the integration AI into teaching and learning, evaluating educational programs and policies, and creating culturally responsible evaluation frameworks for rural Appalachian school mental health programs. I have experience working with large datasets and conducting complex statistical analyses to identify trends and patterns in educational and health outcomes. I am also interested in the ethical implications of data use in education and the importance of equity and inclusion in educational research. I believe that data should be used to empower marginalized communities and promote social justice in education. I am excited to share my research and insights on this blog, and I hope to engage with others who are passionate about education, health and data science.

Within the field of evaluation, data visualization offers powerful tools for enhancing understanding, facilitating stakeholder engagement, and ultimately, informing better decisions (Few, 2012; Evergreen, 2017). As evaluation practice evolves to address increasingly complex social programs and policies, the strategic use of visual displays can transform raw data into actionable insights (Patton, 2018).\nDespite the growing recognition of data visualization’s potential, the field lacks a comprehensive synthesis of its development, key contributors, and emerging trends. Traditional literature reviews often fall short of capturing the breadth and interdisciplinary nature of this topic. Bibliometric analysis, a quantitative approach to mapping the structure of scientific knowledge, offers a rigorous and systematic alternative (Aria & Cuccurullo, 2017; van Eck & Waltman, 2014). By analyzing publication patterns, citation networks, and keyword co-occurrences, bibliometrics can reveal the intellectual landscape of data visualization in evaluation.\nThis study employs bibliometric methods using the PRISMA framework to address critical questions about data visualization evolution, key influences, thematic foci, and global distribution of research on data visualization within the evaluation field. Through a comprehensive analysis of scholarly publications, this research aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking to understand and leverage the power of data visualization to improve evaluation practice.\nResearch Questions\nRQ1- What are the most influential publications, authors, and institutions?\nRQ2- How do different countries or disciplines contribute to this research?\nRQ3- What thematic trends and emerging keywords shape this field?\nRQ4- What types of visualizations and visualization tools are commonly used?\nRQ5- How has data visualization in evaluation evolved over time?\nSignificance\nThis bibliometric study offers significant contributions to both evaluation theory and data visualization practice. First, it identifies critical gaps in the current literature. For instance, the under-representation of accessibility considerations in visualization design highlights a need for future research to focus on inclusive practices that ensure evaluation findings are accessible to diverse audiences. Similarly, the limited number of studies addressing the integration of emerging technologies like AI-driven visualization suggests an area ripe for exploration and innovation.\nSecond, the analysis identifies best practices in the field. The prominence of stakeholder engagement as a central theme underscores the importance of interactive and participatory visualization approaches. The identification of key journals and influential authors provides a valuable guide for researchers and practitioners seeking to stay abreast of key developments. Furthermore, the study reveals effective collaboration networks, offering potential models for fostering interdisciplinary research and knowledge sharing.\nFinally, this study charts future directions for evaluators and data scientists. The increasing emphasis on mixed methods and visual analytics points towards the need for methodological advancements that combine quantitative and qualitative data in meaningful ways. The rise of AI-driven visualization opens new avenues for automating data processing, generating insights, and creating personalized visual displays.
