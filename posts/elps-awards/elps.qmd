## **Honored with Two ELPS Awards!**

I’m deeply honored to share that I received two awards at the 2025 Educational Leadership and Policy Studies (ELPS) Honors and Awards Ceremony:

1.  Graduate Student Research Excellence Award

2.  Graduate Student of the Year Award (Evaluation, Statistics and Methodology Program)

This recognition means so much to me, not just as milestones in my academic journey, but as affirmations of the collaborative effort behind my work. I’m grateful to my faculty advisors, colleagues, and the ELPS community for their unwavering support.

A special thank you to Dr. Jennifer Ann Morrow and Dr. Louis Rocconi, whose guidance has been invaluable, and to my peers in the ESM program for fostering a space where rigorous scholarship and meaningful dialogue thrive.
