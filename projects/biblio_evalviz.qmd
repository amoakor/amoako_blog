## **Project Overview**

## *Introduction*

In an era defined by unprecedented data volume, the ability to effectively visualize and communicate complex information has become critical across disciplines (Kirk, 2019). Within the field of evaluation, data visualization offers powerful tools for enhancing understanding, facilitating stakeholder engagement, and ultimately, informing better decisions (Few, 2012; Evergreen, 2017). As evaluation practice evolves to address increasingly complex social programs and policies, the strategic use of visual displays can transform raw data into actionable insights (Patton, 2018).

Despite the growing recognition of data visualization's potential, the field lacks a comprehensive synthesis of its development, key contributors, and emerging trends. Traditional literature reviews often fall short of capturing the breadth and interdisciplinary nature of this topic. Bibliometric analysis, a quantitative approach to mapping the structure of scientific knowledge, offers a rigorous and systematic alternative (Aria & Cuccurullo, 2017; van Eck & Waltman, 2014). By analyzing publication patterns, citation networks, and keyword co-occurrences, bibliometrics can reveal the intellectual landscape of data visualization in evaluation.

This study employs bibliometric methods using the PRISMA framework to address critical questions about data visualization evolution, key influences, thematic foci, and global distribution of research on data visualization within the evaluation field. Through a comprehensive analysis of scholarly publications, this research aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking to understand and leverage the power of data visualization to improve evaluation practice.

# **Methods**

**Research Design**

This study employs a bibliometric analysis approach to comprehensively map the intellectual landscape of data visualization in evaluation research. The methodology is complemented by a systematic review process, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, to ensure a structured, transparent, and replicable selection of relevant literature (Page al et., 2020).

**Data Collection**

A comprehensive search of the major academic databases (e.g., Scopus, Web of Science) was conducted using predefined search strings related to "data visualization," "evaluation," “evaluation communication,” and related terms. Metadata was downloaded from Scopus and WoS websites using search terms, and CSV files were downloaded.

*Data Extraction:* Relevant metadata (e.g., authors, titles, abstracts, keywords, publication years, citations) were extracted from the selected publications and imported into a bibliometric database.

**Data Analysis Procedure**

*Bibliometric Analysis:* The study applies a range of bibliometric techniques, including Co-citation analysis: to identify clusters of highly cited publications and reveal the intellectual foundations of the field. Keyword co-occurrence mapping: exploring thematic trends and emerging research areas by analyzing the relationships between keywords used in literature. Collaboration network analysis examines patterns of collaboration among authors, institutions, and countries, and identifies key actors and knowledge hubs.

*Data Visualization:* The results of the bibliometric analyses are visualized using network graphs, citation maps, and other visual representations to facilitate the interpretation and communication of the findings.
